# 产品名字 — agent entry point

**一两句产品的HIGHEST VISION SENTENCES**

## The Harness menu — what you need, where the truth lives

| Source | Responsibility | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| [PRD](docs/PRD.md) | Highest-level product blueprint: context, vision, users, problems, product behaviour, core journeys, scope, non-goals and success criteria | Understanding or changing what Clara should do and why |
| [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Highest-level technical blueprint: stack and rationale, system boundaries, module responsibilities, dependencies, data flows and tradeoffs; distinguish implemented state from accepted target | Understanding or changing how Clara works |
| graphify | maps your entire project (code, docs, PDFs, images, videos) into a knowledge graph you can query instead of grepping through files. |
| [Context](CONTEXT.md) | Shared accounting and product vocabulary | Naming concepts or resolving domain ambiguity |
| [PROGRESS](docs/PROGRESS.md) | Minimal session state: current commit, verification, active work, known blockers and next steps | Starting, resuming or handing off a session |

PRD and Architecture are the enduring human-readable sources of truth. GitHub specs describe a
particular delivery scope; tickets own its work, dependencies and completion evidence. Later accepted
decisions may supersede older specs: update the relevant blueprint instead of accumulating conflicting
instructions. Source code and deployment evidence establish what is actually implemented.

## Working protocol

1. Ground to the codebase with `graphify`. Use it to query anything for implementation or clarify.
2. Use `grilling` to settle ambiguity that changes product scope or acceptance before a non-trivial
   build. Look up repository facts directly; ask the owner about unresolved product decisions.
3. Check current official documentation, through Context7 or the vendor, before changing a stack
   integration. Installed versions and lockfiles describe this repository's dependencies.
4. Verify the affected behaviour and update its existing source of truth in the same change. For an
   implementation ticket that source of truth is the module's README, `CONTEXT.md` and the ticket's own
   evidence — never the PRD or Architecture.
5. PRD and Architecture are blueprints, refreshed only after Wayfinder or to-spec settles a product or
   technical decision and before to-tickets: overwrite the affected section (never append ticket
   history), keep each file's maintenance frame in its header, and mark accepted technical targets
   separately from current implementation. Resolve contradictions explicitly; keep detailed acceptance
   in the delivery spec.
6. Push back with real examples: When you push back or recommend, include one real practice close to the case — a 
   company, product, or method you actually know (Linear, Shape Up, Figma), or better, one you can point to (a Mobbin 
   screenshot, a documentation link). Never invent or embellish one: if you know no close example, say so and argue 
   from the Founder's own product instead. An example you cannot point to is labeled as recalled, not presented as 
   fact. 
7. Claims need evidence: Any statement about the state of the world ("the design system covers this", "this rule is 
   already enforced", "that was fixed") 
   must be backed by a checkable source: a file path, a commit, a test or command run, or a link. A real-world 
   anecdote is an argument (7.2), not evidence. 
   If you cannot point to a source, say "unverified" instead of asserting. No evidence, no claim.
8. Wayfinder or grillwithdocs session 的 map / specs 可以add "Milestone" in Github as a 版本控制, 版本控制型号可以在
   wayfinder和agent 一起讨论.
9. 当用户主动说" Idea session " , 这个时期讨论出来的东西可以 as "idea" and "need-triages" lable publish in GitHub 
   Issues.

## CI/CD

## At session start (clock in)
1. Read PROGRESS.md for current state
2. Check to confirm repo is in consistent state
3. Grill user to whether to continue from PROGRESS.md "Next Steps" section.

## Before session end (clock out)
1. Update PROGRESS.md
2. Check to confirm consistent state
3. Commit all completed work
4. IF FOUND OUT edit that didint done by you , grill user to comfirm it as commit and merge to main.
5. Refresh graphify of this project, ensure all local and github main is sync also. ` /graphify . --update `

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues via the `gh` CLI (repo inferred from `git remote -v`). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five default labels (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: a root `CONTEXT.md` plus `docs/adr/`, created lazily by the domain-modeling skill. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.


## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
