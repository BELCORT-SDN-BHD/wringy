# Wringy — agent entry point

Wringy helps merchants run clearly defined content-reward campaigns and creators earn rewards for verified eligible views, with review, appeals and traceable payouts. Content Rewards is the first release toward a broader creator-commerce platform; Malaysia is the first market, with international capabilities opened only when verified.

## The Harness menu — what you need, where the truth lives

| Source | Responsibility | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| [PRD](docs/PRD.md) | Highest-level product blueprint: context, vision, users, problems, product behaviour, core journeys, scope, non-goals and success criteria | Understanding or changing what Wringy should do and why; read its frontmatter maintenance contract |
| [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Highest-level technical blueprint: stack and rationale, system boundaries, module responsibilities, dependencies, data flows and tradeoffs; distinguish implemented state from accepted target | Understanding or changing how Wringy works; read its frontmatter maintenance contract |
| graphify | maps your entire project (code, docs, PDFs, images, videos) into a knowledge graph you can query instead of grepping through files. |
| [Context](CONTEXT.md) | Shared accounting and product vocabulary | Naming concepts or resolving domain ambiguity |
| [PROGRESS](docs/PROGRESS.md) | Minimal session state: current commit, verification, active work, known blockers and next steps | Starting, resuming or handing off a session |

PRD and Architecture are the enduring human-readable sources of truth. GitHub specs describe a
particular delivery scope; tickets own its work, dependencies and completion evidence. Later accepted
decisions may supersede older specs: update the relevant blueprint instead of accumulating conflicting
instructions. Source code and deployment evidence establish what is actually implemented.

## Working protocol

1. Ground to the codebase with `graphify`. Use it to query anything for implementation or clarify.
2. Use `grilling` to settle ambiguity that changes product scope or acceptance before a non-trivial
   build. Look up repository facts directly; ask the owner about unresolved product decisions.
3. Check current official documentation, through Context7 or the vendor, before changing a stack
   integration. Installed versions and lockfiles describe this repository's dependencies.
4. After Wayfinder or to-spec accepts a product or technical decision, refresh the affected PRD / Architecture sections before to-tickets. Read and preserve each file's YAML frontmatter (`required_focus` and `maintenance`); rewrite current sections instead of appending session or ticket history. Keep specific business values and algorithms in [campaign defaults](phase-0/foundation/campaign-defaults-v1.md), detailed acceptance in the delivery spec, decision rationale in the spec / ADR, and execution evidence on the ticket. Resolve contradictions explicitly. Update implemented state only with code / test / deployment evidence; an accepted target is not an implemented capability. Git retains history.
5. Push back with real examples: When you push back or recommend, include one real practice close to the case — a 
   company, product, or method you actually know (Linear, Shape Up, Figma), or better, one you can point to (a Mobbin 
   screenshot, a documentation link). Never invent or embellish one: if you know no close example, say so and argue 
   from the Founder's own product instead. An example you cannot point to is labeled as recalled, not presented as 
   fact. 
6. Claims need evidence: Any statement about the state of the world ("the design system covers this", "this rule is 
   already enforced", "that was fixed") 
   must be backed by a checkable source: a file path, a commit, a test or command run, or a link. A real-world 
   anecdote is an argument (7.2), not evidence. 
   If you cannot point to a source, say "unverified" instead of asserting. No evidence, no claim.
7. Wayfinder or grillwithdocs session 的 map / specs 可以add "Milestone" in Github as a 版本控制, 版本控制型号可以在
   wayfinder和agent 一起讨论.
8. 当用户主动说" Idea session " , 这个时期讨论出来的东西可以 as "idea" and "need-triages" lable publish in GitHub 
   Issues.

## CI/CD

## At session start (clock in)
1. Read PROGRESS.md for current state
2. Check to confirm repo is in consistent state
3. Grill user to whether to continue from PROGRESS.md "Next Steps" section.

## Before session end (clock out)
1. Update PROGRESS.md
2. Check to confirm consistent state
3. Commit all completed work
4. IF FOUND OUT edit that didint done by you , grill user to comfirm it as commit and merge to main.
5. Refresh graphify of this project, ensure all local and github main is sync also. ` /graphify . --update `

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues via the `gh` CLI (repo inferred from `git remote -v`). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five default labels (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: a root `CONTEXT.md` plus `docs/adr/`, created lazily by the domain-modeling skill. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.


## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
